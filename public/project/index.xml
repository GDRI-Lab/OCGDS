      <description>PGR contains agronomically useful information in Peanut species, including genome sequences, genetic maps, genes, gene families, and mapped traits and related information. The data will be maintained on two sites: PGR and http://www.fafu.edu.cn/. The &amp;ldquo;PGR&amp;rdquo; site makes use of several open-source projects, facilitating more efficient collaboration with other research groups using and developing these tools (e.g. PeanutBase, ICRISAT, CSFL, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Oil Crops Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences).</description>

      <description>The Brassica oleracea Genome Database (Bolbase) was designed to provide users a useful and unique genome data source in the field of studying Brassica oleracea. In this database, it contained two important sections. First, it supplied genomic data and genomic components data, for genomic data, it mainly contains genome structure, scaffold sequences, and psuedochromosome sequences; for genomic components data, it mainly includes putative protein-coding genes (gene location, gene structure, protein feature, gene functional annotation, orthologs and syntenic regions), repeats elments (type, classification, location and sequences) and predicted non-coding RNAs (type, classification, location, description and sequences), and so on.</description>

      <description>PTGBase is a public database to collect plant genes generated by tandem duplication mechanism in the process of plant evolution. So far, PTGBase mainly focus on plants with available whole genome sequences especially for assembled pseudomolecules with ordered gene models. In this database, we have collected 39 plant species arrayed in 54,130 tandem repeat gene clusters containing 129,652 genes. PTGBase is freely available for download. The researchers or scientist can extract the full list of repeat genes, their coding sequences and protein sequences, as well as whole genome sets about sequenced plant species.</description>

      <description>Sinbase is a web-based database with comprehensive sesame genomic, genetic and comparative genomic information. Sinbase includes sequences of assembled sesame pseudomolecular chromosomes, protein-coding genes (27,148), transposable elements (372,167) and non-coding RNAs (1,748). In particular, Sinbase provides unique and valuable information on colinear regions with various plant genomes, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Vitis vinifera and Solanum lycopersicum. Sinbase also provides a useful search function and data mining tools, including a keyword search and local BLAST service.</description>

      <description>The Oil Crops Seed ESTs database (ocsESTdb) was developed to provide users a comprehansive seed expression sequence tags database of oil crops for comparative analysis. In ocsEASTdb, it provided ESTs and unigenes detail information of four oil crop species, A.hypogaea, B.napus (high or low oil), G.max, S.indicum. For each unigene, ocsESTdb supplied nucleotide basic information, functional annotation and sequence information (full-length, ORF and peptide seq.), as well as KEGG pathway that unigene participated in and metabolism network that products of unigenes participated in.</description>

      <description>BTriDB (The Brassica Triplication Database) was constructed to provide users a useful and unique triplicated genes database in the field of studying Brassica lineage. In this database, it supplied genomic data, transcriptome data, comparative genome information based on triplicated blocks, this data includes psuedochromosome sequence, scaffold sequence, genome structure, and gene location, gene structure, protein feature, gene functional annotation, and so on. All of the data can be downloaded on line very conveniently.</description>

      <description>The Brassica Database (BRAD) is now a new database which includes not only newly released genome sequences of Brassiceae species, but also published genomic data of most other Brassicaceae species. In total, we provided services for 3X genomes or genome versions from 35 species (refer to Species info). The genomic data included mainly genome assemblies, predicted gene models, gene annotations. These data can be searched in JBrowse or BLAST. They continue offering the featured service of the searching for syntenic genes, which are generated by Synorths, based on their syntenic relationships to the genes in Arabidopsis.</description>

      <description>The PlantRGDB is the first plant disease resistance genes data resource that combines information on genomics, transcriptome and comparative genomics. In this database, extensive annotations including gene detail, protein functional domains, GO assignment, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of sequences for all R genes are provided in detail, and also offered R genes distribution on pseudochromosome for genome completed species. Particularly, the PlantRGDB supply genome-scale comparative studies of R genes in sequencing species and cross-link between these making it a unique and comprehensive resource.</description>

      <description>SoyBase, the USDA-ARS soybean genetic database, is a comprehensive repository for professionally curated genetics, genomics and related data resources for soybean. SoyBase contains the most current genetic, physical and genomic sequence maps integrated with qualitative and quantitative traits. The quantitative trait loci (QTL) represent more than 18 years of QTL mapping of more than 90 unique traits. SoyBase also contains the well-annotated &amp;lsquo;Williams 82&amp;rsquo; genomic sequence and associated data mining tools.</description>
