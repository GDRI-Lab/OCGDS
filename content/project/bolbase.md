description = "The Brassica oleracea Genome Database (Bolbase) was designed to provide users a useful and unique genome data source in the field of studying  Brassica oleracea. In this database, it contained two important sections. First, it supplied genomic data and genomic components data, for genomic data, it mainly contains genome structure, scaffold sequences, and psuedochromosome sequences; for genomic components data, it mainly includes putative protein-coding genes (gene location, gene structure, protein feature, gene functional annotation, orthologs and syntenic regions), repeats elments (type, classification, location and sequences) and predicted non-coding RNAs (type, classification, location, description and sequences), and so on. Second, it provides thorough analysis on syntenic regions and triplicated blocks for Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana. All of the data can be downloaded on line very conveniently. This database also provided browse, search, download, manual,  sitemap, and manual of web server. All of data information will update constantly. It's a useful database for scientific research in the genetics and molecular breeding fields."
