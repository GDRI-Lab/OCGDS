In this database, it supplied genomic data, transcriptome data, comparative genome information based on triplicated blocks, this data includes psuedochromosome sequence, scaffold sequence, genome structure, and gene location, gene structure, protein feature, gene functional annotation, and so on. All of the data can be downloaded on line very conveniently. This database also provided browse, search, download, manual,  sitemap, and instruction of web server. All of data information will update constantly. It is a usefulb database for scientific research in the genetics and molecular breeding fields."
