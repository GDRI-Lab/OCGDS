description = "The PlantRGDB is the first plant disease resistance genes data resource that combines information on genomics, transcriptome and comparative genomics. In this database, extensive annotations including gene detail, protein functional domains, GO assignment, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of sequences for all R genes are provided in detail, and also offered R genes distribution on pseudochromosome for genome completed species. Particularly, the PlantRGDB supply genome-scale comparative studies of R genes in sequencing species and cross-link between these making it a unique and comprehensive resource. This rich information of R genes that we collected will provide an unprecedented opportunity for plant molecular biologists in this field."
