PGR contains agronomically useful information in Peanut species, including genome sequences, genetic maps, genes, gene families, and mapped traits and related information. The data will be maintained on two sites: PGR and http://www.fafu.edu.cn/. The "PGR" site makes use of several open-source projects, facilitating more efficient collaboration with other research groups using and developing these tools (e.g. PeanutBase, ICRISAT, CSFL, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Oil Crops Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences).

For more information, you can refer to **[PGR](http://peanutgr.fafu.edu.cn/index.php)**.
