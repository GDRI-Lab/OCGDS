# About OCGDS

The **Oil Crops Genomics Database System (OCGDS)** was designed to collecte oil crops genomics and related databases and resources, which is hosted at [OCRI](http://ocri.caas.cn/en/) of [CAAS](http://www.caas.cn/en/). It is now maintained by [GDRIlab](http://www.ocri-genomics.org/gdrilab/). Until now, we have collected the following databases and related resources:

- [BnPIR](http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/bnapus/index.php)
- [BRAD](http://39.100.233.196/#/)
- [PeanutBase](https://www.peanutbase.org/home)
- [SoyBase](https://soybase.org/)
- [PGR: Peanut Genome Resources](http://peanutgr.fafu.edu.cn/index.php)
- [Sunflower Genome Database](https://sunflowergenome.org/)
- [INRA Sunflower Bioinformatics Resources](https://www.heliagene.org/)
- [Sinbase](http://ocri-genomics.org/Sinbase/index.html)
